## FLOX

FLOX is a modular framework for building trading systems with polyglot strategy bindings and AI-friendly developer tools.
Strategies run on one C++ core in Python, Node.js, Codon, or embedded JavaScript. Same strategy code goes from backtest to live without a rewrite step.

Documentation is available at [flox-foundation.github.io/flox](https://flox-foundation.github.io/flox)

## Language bindings

| Language | Install | Docs |
|----------|---------|------|
| Python | `pip install flox-py` | [reference](https://flox-foundation.github.io/flox/reference/python/) |
| Node.js | `npm install @flox-foundation/flox` | [reference](https://flox-foundation.github.io/flox/reference/node/) |
| Codon | build from source | [reference](https://flox-foundation.github.io/flox/reference/codon/) |
| JavaScript (embedded) | bundled with C++ build | [reference](https://flox-foundation.github.io/flox/reference/quickjs/) |
| C API | `libflox_capi.so` | [reference](https://flox-foundation.github.io/flox/reference/api/capi/flox_capi/) |

All bindings expose the same strategy API, indicators, order books, backtesting, and data I/O. The C API is the integration point for adding support for any other language.

## AI companion

`flox-mcp` is a Model Context Protocol server that gives AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Cline) grounded access to the FLOX surface — symbol lookups across bindings, scaffolders, indicator and backtest tools, full-text doc search.

```bash
pip install flox-mcp
```

See [the package README](./mcp/README.md) for setup and the full tool list.

## Connectors

Native exchange connectors (Bybit, Bitget, Hyperliquid, Polymarket) live under [`connectors/`](./connectors/) and build with `-DFLOX_BUILD_CONNECTORS=ON`. The flag defaults to OFF so a backtest-only or research build doesn't pay the dependency cost. See the [connectors README](./connectors/README.md) for adapter notes and the optional Polymarket Rust toolchain step.

## Build options

The CMake options that gate every optional artefact (bindings, demo, tools, tests, benchmarks, connectors) are catalogued in [`docs/build/feature-flags.md`](https://flox-foundation.github.io/flox/build/feature-flags/). Defaults are OFF so a bare `cmake -B build` produces only the core C++ static library.

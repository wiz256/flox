scripts/gen_llms_txt.py

Generate `docs/llms.txt` and `docs/llms-full.txt` per the llmstxt.org spec
so AI agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Cline, etc.) can ground themselves in
FLOX docs.

`llms.txt` is a short curated map (sections + links). `llms-full.txt` is
the concatenated body of the same curated set — small enough to fit a
modern model's context window. Auto-generated C++ core API reference
(`docs/reference/api/{aggregator,backtest,book,...}`) is intentionally
excluded: it adds bulk without helping binding users write valid code,
and C++ extension authors will read the headers anyway.

CI gate: run this before push; if `git diff docs/llms*.txt` is non-empty
after running, the files are stale.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/gen_llms_txt.py            # write
    python3 scripts/gen_llms_txt.py --check    # verify in sync, exit 1 if not
